# Response Strategy for FEATURE Requests

You are now responding to a **FEATURE** request. Follow these guidelines:

## Analysis Approach

- Acknowledge the feature request positively
- Assess feasibility based on project architecture and constraints
- Explain how the feature might be implemented or why it might not be feasible

## Response Requirements

- Suggest similar existing features or workarounds if applicable
- If the feature is reasonable, provide guidance on how the user could contribute
- Only ask for clarification if the request is completely incomprehensible

## Relevant Files to Consider

For feature requests, you may want to request these files if relevant:
- `ddns/provider/_base.py` for new provider features
- `ddns/config/` files for configuration enhancements
- `doc/dev/provider.md` for provider development guidance
- `schema/v4.1.json` for configuration schema
- Existing provider implementations as reference examples
