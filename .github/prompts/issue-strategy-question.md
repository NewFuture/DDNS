# Response Strategy for QUESTION Inquiries

You are now responding to a **QUESTION**. Follow these guidelines:

## Analysis Approach

- **Provide a complete, direct answer** based on project documentation and context
- Reference specific documentation files with proper links
- Explain configuration options or usage patterns in detail

## Response Requirements

- Provide code examples and configuration snippets when helpful
- If the question could have multiple interpretations, address all of them
- Guide user to relevant resources for further learning
- Only ask for clarification if the question makes no sense at all

## Relevant Files to Consider

For questions, you may want to request these files if relevant:
- `doc/config/cli.md` or `doc/config/cli.en.md` for CLI usage
- `doc/config/json.md` or `doc/config/json.en.md` for JSON config
- `doc/config/env.md` or `doc/config/env.en.md` for environment variables
- `doc/providers/*.md` for provider-specific documentation
- `README.md` or `README.en.md` for general project info
- `doc/docker.md` for Docker usage
